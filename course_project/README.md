# PDFChatbot

![project_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76c3e4e2-4151-4438-b25b-621f97b131bf)


This project is part of the **LLM Zoomcamp 2024** course hosted by DataTalksClub. The aim of this project is to create a chatbot that can assist with questions about uploaded PDF documents using various LangChain components and a Gradio interface.

## Overview

PDFChatbot is a powerful tool designed to assist users with extracting and querying information from PDF documents. It leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing models and embeddings to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Upload and process multiple PDF files.
- **Contextual Question Answering**: Ask questions related to the content of the uploaded documents.
- **History Management**: Maintains the history of the chat sessions.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface built with Gradio.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Blaqadonis/my_rag_project.git
    cd course_project
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file and update it with your configuration.
    ```env
    HUGGINGFACE_HUB_API_KEY = '...'
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = '...'
    GROQ_API_KEY = '...'
    LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY= 'sk-...'
    LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY= 'pk-...'
    LANGFUSE_HOST= 'https://cloud.langfuse.com'
    ```

### Configuration

The `config.yaml` file contains all the necessary configuration settings for the chatbot. Update the file with the appropriate values for your models and settings.

```yaml
vector_store:
  model_name: "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"  

llm:
  model_name: "llama-3.1-70b-versatile"    
  temperature: 0
```



Running the Application
=======
## Running the Application

To start the chatbot application, simply run:

```sh
python app.py
```
This will launch a Gradio interface where you can upload PDF files and interact with the chatbot.

## Usage
* Upload PDF: Click on the upload button to select one or more PDF files.
* Ask Questions: Type your question in the text box and click send. The chatbot will provide answers based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.
* View Document: The front page of the uploaded PDF will be displayed in the image box.

## Evaluation
To ensure the chatbot's performance is optimal, an evaluation process has been set up to check the accuracy of the responses and detect any hallucinations. This evaluation generates two main reports:

```all-mpnet-base-v2-report.csv```: Evaluates the vector store model's retrieval accuracy.

```llama-3.1-70b-versatile-hallucination_report.csv```: Assesses the language model's responses for hallucinations.

### Running the Evaluation
Run the evaluation scripts:

After processing your PDFs and interacting with the chatbot, you can evaluate the performance of your choice vector database, or the performance of your LLM
by running the following scripts:

``` python knowledgebase_eval.py ```

``` python generator_eval.py ```

These scripts will generate two CSV reports:

```
all-mpnet-base-v2-report.csv
llama-3.1-70b-versatile-hallucination_report.csv
 ```

### Understanding the Reports:

The ```all-mpnet-base-v2-report.csv``` report provides a detailed analysis of how accurately the vector store retrieves the relevant document chunks based on the queries.
The ```llama-3.1-70b-versatile-hallucination_report.csv``` report highlights any hallucinations in the responses generated by the llama-3.1-70b-versatile model, ensuring that the chatbot maintains a high level of factual accuracy.

### Additional Notes
Waiting for the First Query: The Time Taken to First Token (TTFT) for this application is quite high, depending on your computer's specifications. Therefore, you may have to wait a while for the first query to get answered. However, it is smooth-sailing after that.
